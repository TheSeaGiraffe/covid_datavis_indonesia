# Indonesian COVID-19 Dashboard

This repo contains code for a shiny app that serves as a dashboard for various charts
about the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia. It uses data sourced from the WHO and gathered
by the Humanitarian Data Exchange as part of their "COVID-19 Pandemic in Locations with a
Humanitarian Response Plan" initiative. The data used for this dashboard can be found
[here][1].
